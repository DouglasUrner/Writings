# Ditching Meta

### 11 January 2025

Meta's rapid string of announcements that it:

* Will no longer do fact checking,
* Will explicity allow hate speech directed at women, immigrants, and the LGBTQ community, and
* Will no longer engage in work to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace

has a lot of people questioning how and even if they should continue using Meta's platforms.

I've been thinking about this too and have started collecting ideas. I'm going to keep updating this as I learn more and I'd appreciate feedback, I'm douglasurner on Bluesky.

## It Won't Be Seamless

Expect some friction: be patient with yourself and your friends. Allow yourself to take the time you need to make the changes that you can. Respect that some folks (including you) may not be able or willing to completely disconnect from Meta. Even small steps matter, don't let the challenge of disconnecting completely stop you from doing something.

One of the guiding principles in my thinking about social media platforms is understanding their business model. Meta's platforms are *very* expensive to run, and that money does not come (directly) from the users of the platforms. Meta makes money by monetizing what they can learn from the behavior of their users. At a bare minimum they are selling ads that are targeted using your information.

Remembering the addage: *If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer, you're the product being sold.* I want to find platforms where the revenue stream is transparent and not based on monetizing information gleaned from the users.

## Block Meta

Even if you don't use Meta's products they are probably still tracking you and monetizing your information. This January 17th, 2025 article from the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a good guide to stopping that: [Mad at Meta? Don't Let Them Collect and Monetize Your Personal Data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/mad-meta-dont-let-them-collect-and-monetize-your-personal-data)

## Replace WhatsApp with [Signal Messanger](https://signal.org)

A good alternative to WhatsApp is [Signal Messanger](https://signal.org). Signal has most, if not all of the functionality of WhatsApp. It's "owned" by a 501c3 non-profit in the US which does fundraising to support its operations. So there is at least a chance that the Signal foundation is honest in their claims of a commitment to private communitcation.

Signal is available on iOS and Android. Signal can also be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows, but that requires that you first have it installed on your phone and that you use your phone to authenticate your computer.

## Things You Can Do

### Get off of WhatsApp

* If you have a small community that you're communicating with it may be as simple as just letting them know that you'd like to move to a Signal or some other platform.
* In your WhatsApp profile you can let people know where you've moved to.
* You can also use the status update to do the same thing (but, I think this expires/resets after 24 hours).
* You don't have to quit cold turkey, you can check out Signal or some other tool while you continue to use WhatsApp when you have to.

If you feel like being a bit of an activist you can suggest Signal as a way to connect, or even push back when someone wants to connect on WhatsApp: "I'd prefer to use Signal."

## Quit or Cutback on Facebook

I don't know of an alternative platform that does what Facebook does. So you may be stuck there if you're using Facebook for things that you can't or aren't ready to give up.

### Take a break from Facebook

Pick a date (the 20th of January strikes me as quite asuspicious) and go "Facebook sober" -- maybe delete the app from your phone. Just try it out and see how it feels. I'd suggest deciding on something to do instead of Facebook so that you have an alternative when the urge strikes: read a book, go for a walk, play with the cat... Again, be kind to yourself, Facebook has been filling a need and you'll likely miss it -- so plan for that.

If you decide to go back, don't beat yourself up.

### Cut back on Facebook

Facebook makes money by collecting information about you (and then selling it) and pushing ads to you. The less time you spend on Facebook, the less money they make. If enough of us cut back they will notice. They might even change their behavior. Ways to cut back:

* **Connect with your interests off of Facebook.** Look for mailing lists or independent sites that are about your interests. In my experience the content there is often of higher quality and less "noisey" than on Facebook. If you have the tech skills offer to create or run one.
* **Use the [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org) plugin in your browser.** The Facebook Like button and other social media "widgets" allow Meta and other social media companies to track your reading habits. Privacy Badger can [replace widgets with a placeholder](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/privacy-badger-puts-you-control-widgets). The placeholder prevents your reading from being tracked unless you click on the widget (for example, to like a post on Facebook). If you use Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Opera to read Facebook you can install the Privacy Badger plugin (I think it comes pre-installed on recent versions of Firefox). A plugin for Safari is being developed. Privacy Badger also blocks "third-party" trackers on all websites.
* **Bookmark your Facebook groups.** Groups seem to have fewer ads, and so probably generate less revenue for Meta. You can bookmark the groups and jump directly to them. This may help if you're easily tempted by what's on your home page.
* **Let advertisers know that supporting Meta lowers your opinion of them.** One way to do this is to post something on their Facebook page. It might be interesting to see how many likes you get.
