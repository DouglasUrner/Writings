# Ditching Meta

7 January 2025

**TL;DR:** the way we use the Internet has made some people fabulously -- obscenely -- wealthy and powerful. That wealth and power depends on us continuing to use the Internet in the ways that have built their fortunes, and which threaten to destroy western democracies and the promise of the Internet. It is time to reconsider how we use the Internet. By changing the way we use the Internet we can change the cost-benefit ratio for kowtowing to Trump, at worst we can separate ourselves from their manipulation and information hoarding, at best as they see their sway and income diminish in response to their lack of courage and principle perhaps they will reconsider. Jump to [Suggestions](#suggestions) for some possible steps to take.

10° to the left of center in good times, 10° [or more] to the right of center when it affects me personally.
-- Phil Ochs, "Love Me, I'm a Liberal"

## The Big Donors

If you ever doubted that Phil Ochs was right, the steady stream of wealthy suplicants making their way to (or moving in at) Mar-a-Lago should convince you.

### Consider this list:

* Elon Musk
* Amazon: $2M ($1M in cash and another $1M in streaming services for the election -- apparently Twitter/X isn't up to the task...)
* Sam Altman: $1M
* Mark Zuckerberg: $1M
* Uber / Khosrowshahi: $1M each
* Robinhood Markets: $2M
* Ken Griffin (Citadel): $1M
* Bank of America
* Goldman Sachs
* Brad Garlinghouse / Ripple: $5M in cryptocurrency
* Perplexity: $1M

Consider that Jeff Bezos is worth around $240,000,000,000. He's donating, through Amazon, $1,000,000. That's 0.0004 percent of his net worth, about the equivalent of a small latte to someone with a net worth of a million dollars, or a decent meal out to someone with ten million. In other words, it's nothing. Think about that.

Many of us were naïve in the early days of the Internet, believing that knowledge was a universally sought good that moved the world forward, that the scientific method worked, that experts could be recognized by the usefulness of their insights (and that many were willing to share their insight and experience), and that the "arc of history" would indeed bend towards justice and understanding. So we shared what we knew and patiently explained to those who were pioneering the "art" of spreading disinformation. We were optimists.

Democracy, even the sembalance of democracy, requires active participation -- that's the nice way to say that it requires time and energy. Civic engagement can be energizing, but often it is also exhausting, especially if you're burning the candle at both ends to keep home and friends/family together. So, besides what I'm suggesting here, do what you can to support the efforts of folks to organize. The wealthy and powerful have long recognized the threat presented by organized labor movement that fights not just for "wages & working conditions" but also for the quality of the working experience and the right to act in solidarity with our allies. They have been very successful in making it a crime to respect and support the struggles of other workers and to remove all but the most narrowly defined issues of compensation and working conditions from the bargining table.

## The Cost of Free

*If you are not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.* -- blue_beetle (aka Andrew Lewis), 2010 on MetaFiler. Lewis made it incisive and memorable, but folks have been warning us about this at least as far back as the 1970s ([Richard Serra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Serra) & Carlota Fay Schoolman made a short video “[Television Delivers People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Delivers_People) in 1973, you can watch [a copy of the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvZYwaQlJsg)” on YouTube).

In real terms, this means that the reason why we're not paying to use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc. is because they are able to extract enough value from us, both in terms of advertising impressions and information about our lives and interests to make a handsome profit.

In evaluating platforms to replace the "big guys" it's essential to take a look at their business model, and to remember that if you aren't paying them something to help defray the cost of running their service someone else is -- at the very best, it's like Wikipedia and someone else is paying your share, at worst you're trading information about your life that they are quite likely using against you for the right to pretend that they are providing you with a wonderful free service. Once, there might have been a middle ground where you paid for the service by watching, or ignoring, ads. But those days are long gone. Consuming media with a computer on each end of the link and a fast network in between makes it inconcievable that the ads you see aren't targeted to you.

## Encryption & Metadata

Encrypting data makes it much harder -- for some purposes close to impossible -- for an outsider, someone who doesn't have access to the encryption keys, to view the data. Meta claims that conversations on WhatsApp are securely encrypted. That's probably true, though it wouldn't be overly paranoid to wonder if Meta maintained a "backdoor" that would allow them, or others with a "need to know" to view the contents of communications on WhatsApp. But, what's also true, is that WhatsApp lacks a "visible means of support" -- there are no ads and no subscription fee -- but Meta maintains some rather expensive hardware and pays developers and operations staff to support the "service." So, there is likely something they are "harvesting" to defray the cost. That something is *metadata*, information about information. In the case of WhatsApp, Meta can look at who you communicate with (and who you know if you share you address book with them), how often you communicate with them, who you interact with in groups, who initiates and responds to discussions, the time of day and your location when you use WhatsApp, and probably quite a bit more -- it's quite interesting to poke around on LinkedIn and look at the job titles and training of folks at Meta.

Don't let anyone reassure you that they can't see your communications and "the only" data they are collecting about you as you use of their app is metadata. Metadata is a **big** deal, it reveals a **lot** of information, often as much or more than the content of the communication.
