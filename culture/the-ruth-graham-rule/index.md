# The Ruth Graham Rule

Surely Billy Graham's wife, Ruth, held herself to the [Billy Graham rule][bgr]. So I propose a thought experiment wondering what would happen if women in positions of leadership were similarly inclined. The absudity of the result should make it clear that the only reason we can even talk about the Billy Graham rule is because of the widespread sexism in our culture and the paucity of women in signicficant roles in almost every aspect of public life.
