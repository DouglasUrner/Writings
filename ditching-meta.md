# Ditching Meta

7 January 2025

10° to the left of center in good times, 10° [or more] to the right of center when it affects me personally.
-- Phil Ochs, "Love Me, I'm a Liberal"

If you ever doubted that Phil Ochs was right, the steady stream of wealthy suplicants making their way to (or moving in at) Mar-a-Lago should convince you.

**TL;DR:** the way we use the Internet has made some people fabulously -- obscenely -- wealthy and powerful. That wealth and power depends on us continuing to use the Internet in the ways that have built their fortunes, and which threaten to destroy western democracies and the promise of the Internet. It is time to reconsider how we use the Internet. By changing the way we use the Internet we can change the cost-benefit ratio for kowtowing to Trump, at worst we can separate ourselves from their manipulation and information hoarding, at best as they see their sway and income diminish in response to their lack of courage and principle perhaps they will reconsider. Jump to [Suggestions](#suggestions) for some possible steps to take.

Many of us were naïve in the early days of the Internet, believing that knowledge was a universally sought good that moved the world forward, that the scientific method worked, that experts could be recognized by the usefulness of their insights (and that many were willing to share their insight and experience), and that the "arc of history" would indeed bend towards justice and understanding. So we shared what we knew and patiently explained to those who were pioneering the "art" of spreading disinformation. We were optimists.

Democracy, even the sembalance of democracy, requires active participation -- that's the nice way to say that it requires time and energy. Civic engagement can be energizing, but often it is also exhausting, especially if you're burning the candle at both ends to keep home and friends/family together. So, besides what I'm suggesting here, do what you can to support the efforts of folks to organize. The wealthy and powerful have long recognized the threat presented by organized labor movement that fights not just for "wages & working conditions" but also for the quality of the working experience and the right to act in solidarity with our allies. They have been very successful in making it a crime to respect and support the struggles of other workers and to remove all but the most narrowly defined issues of compensation and working conditions from the bargining table.
