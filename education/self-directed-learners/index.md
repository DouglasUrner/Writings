# Nuturing the passion to learn

My informal observation of young children, suggests that passion for learning is an inate, if fragile human, trait.
The urge to struggle with ideas, to make sense of some parts of the world, is a fundamental part of human existance.

Children have it, somehow many loose it.

The educational system acknowledges that it is important and struggles to restore it. Somethings are better preserved than rebuilt.

To learn, to make sense, to make change (or to nurture and sustain), requires -- in part -- a body of foundational knowledge.
That foundation is also instrumental in transmitting and evolving our cultures.
This foundation is not learning or wisdom, any more than a guitar is music, it is a tool that *serves* the process of learning, that deepens understanding, and that can inform our efforts to perfect and strengthen our communities -- as a guitar provides a way to make music.
As we grow older, it is natural and valuable, to recognize the value of the foundation.
I think the educational system, in the US at least, has put the cart before the horse, mistaking the foundation for learning. The value of the foundation is that it lets us build, standing quite literally on the shoulders of giants[^culture].

[culture]: Who we call giants, and whose shoulders we know about, and the ones we choose to stand on may be the definition of culture.
  
It is, I think, the passion for leaning, the need to make sense, and the desire to "create a more perfect union" that give the foundation its import and legitimacy. If you take those away "learning" the foundation becomes, at best, blind faith and at worst compliance. For those students in whom the passion for leaning has not been quashed, the connection to the foundation may survive, but we are hardly fostering the connections that would fuel a student's passion for learning with the power they could be finding in the foundation.

The connections of our courses to our students are essentially random -- sometimes a student "gets it" and engages with the course and the content. But rarely are we intentional about this, rarely are we able to be intentional about it. We don't know how to design courses that give students the lattitude to pursue the foundation
