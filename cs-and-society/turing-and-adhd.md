# What if Alan Turing had ADHD?

Alan Turing is often described as single-minded, someone who would only pursue a problem if it interested him.

British system supports / enables this (focus of Oxbridge schools).
US system -- requiring breadth and a "good" GPA -- turns it into a deficit (or at the very least requires recognizing the pattern and changing in very early on).

ADHD and starting tasks.
