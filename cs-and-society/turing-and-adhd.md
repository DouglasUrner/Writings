In *The Mystery of ADHD Motivation, Solved* Thomas E. Brown, PH.D. argues that the challenge shared by many people with ADHD -- getting started on "uninteresting" tasks[^getting-started] -- is a direct result of the neurological differences in the ADHD brain.

British system supports / enables this (focus of Oxbridge schools).
US system -- requiring breadth and a "good" GPA -- turns it into a deficit (or at the very least requires recognizing the pattern and changing in very early on).

ADHD and starting tasks.
