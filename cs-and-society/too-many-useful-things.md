# If we can compute it, must we compute it?

> *The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people.* Karl Marx.[^marx]

In Barbara Kingsolver's *Unsheltered*[^unsheltered] Tig describes to Willa the *amarillo* ride sharing system.

In Cuba cars are scarce, parts are scarce, gasoline is expensive -- the perfect catalysts for a public transit system. The systems that have arisen include the typical busses and taxis, but alongside of these is the *punto amarillo*[^amarillo] ride sharing system. Many of these "yellow points" have a dispatcher who is responsible for coordinating the ride sharing. At first you might think that the dispatch task could (definitely) and should (hold that thought) be "appified."

Let's assume for the moment that the infrastructure and devices are in place to make "appification" a possiblity. So we can focus on the question -- *should* the project of replacing amarillos (the ride coordinators) with an app be undertaken? Assume for the moment that working as an amarillo is a "good" job. That is, we assume that:
* Amarillos earn a living wage[^living].
* The work is reasonably safe and engaging.
* Respect and dignity are afforded to amarillos.

There will surely be benefits that can be assigned to replacing human amarillos with an app. For example:
* It would be possible to see potential rides and riders. This could make travel planning more predictable.
* There could be a higher level of accountability.
* The immediate cost (direct labor costs) of the system might be lower.

But the outcomes would not be equivalent:
* Work would shift -- coders and IT types would replace amarillos. This point is hard to underestimate, the entry bar for the job of amarillo is probably quite low. Still the ceiling is high and there is likely much to learn, both about the process in general and about the specifics of the place and time. I imagine the job is engaging and one can grow in it. An amarillo probably has stature in the community. There is a need for a lot of amarillos and the work probably seems secure.

  Coding has a much higher entry bar and developing the app would likely be a project for a small team -- probably well under 100 developers, managers, and operations staff. Once the app is up and working, the number of developers needed will likely drop considerably.
* The punto amarillo would now be an empty place.
* The app might not have the insight or flexibility of a human.
* Travel would be more throughly and easily surveilled.

Urban and transportation planning are never easy tasks - the future is notoriously hard to predict and the lessons of the unintended consequences of even the most benign and well intentioned of plans should stand as a powerful argument for the application of *agile principles*[^agile]. Low cost experiments using existing resources -- in this case empty seats in cars -- enable measurments of demand and impacts while shortening implementation timelines and minimizing the delay in implementing changes.

No doubt this process is "efficient" -- but how should efficiency be measured? Put another way, what are we trying to optimize for? A number of, possibly incompatible, options present themselves:
* Lowest immediate cost (wages and other easily assigned opperating costs).
* Highest travel efficency (getting people where they want to go with minimal hassle).
* Lowest public transit cost.
* Highest return for those who invest in the system.

We have to consider what tasks to automate (and apply artificial intelligence to) and how we choose to apply the automation:
* Automating tasks that are tedious and/or impossible for humans (finding primes).
* Automating tasks that are impossible for humans (autoland systems for aircraft).
* Augmenting human capabilities (micro surgery systems).

Two examples to consider are the introduction of CNC machines to replace skilled machinists in manufacturing where the machining skill was often taken away from the shop floor and moved to designers or programmers well removed from the machines; and the move to containerizaiton in the Port of Oakland where the longshoremen learned new skills and the redundancy of longshoremen brought about by the increases of efficency was handled by attrition.

[^amarillo]: A system of mandated ride sharing introduced during the fuel shortages of the 1990s. At designated points a person wearing a yellow uniform coordinated ridesharing.

[^agile]: Agile in a software development methodology that emphasizes frequent releases of (quite likely incomplete and imperfect) applications so that end users can try it out and provide feedback.

[^living]: A wage that enables a person to support themselves and their dependants at a "civilized" standard -- to have the necesities, to save enough to be free from econmic stress, and to enjoy a modicum of leisure.
