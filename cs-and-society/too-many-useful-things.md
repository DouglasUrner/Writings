In Cuba cars are scarce, busses are scarce, gasoline is expensive. The perfect catalysts for a public transit system. The systems that have arisen include the typical busses and taxis, but alongside of these is the *punto amarillo*[^amarillo] ride sharing system. Many of these "yellow points" have a dispatcher who is responsible for coordinating the ride sharing. At first you might think that the dispatch task could (indeed) and should (hold that thought) be "appified."

Urban and transportation planning are never easy - the future is notoriously hard to predict and the lessons of the unintended consequences of even the most benign and well intentioned of plans should stand as a powerful argument for the application of *agile principles*.[^agile]

[^marx]: Marx wrote this in the mid-1800s as steam power and the industrial revolution were improving the efficiency of labor and consequently reducing the number of jobs. The industrial revolution foreshadowed the modern age of computing and artificial intelligence.

[^amarillo]: A system of mandated ride sharing introduced during the fuel shortages of the 1990s. At designated points a person wearing a yellow uniform coordinated ridesharing.
