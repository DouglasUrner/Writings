> *The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people.* Karl Marx. [^1]

[^1]: Marx wrote this in the mid-1800s as steam power and the industrial revolution were improving the efficiency of labor and consequently reducing the number of jobs. The industrial revolution foreshadowed the modern age of computing and artificial intelligence.
