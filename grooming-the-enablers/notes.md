The right-wing obsession with "grooming" and attacking safe places for LGBTQA+ people -- especially young people -- actually enables the real groomers.

By making it dangerous for young people to be out, and for anyone to openly acknowledge and discuss the existinace of non-cis & heteronormative people the right is creating the conditions that makes the grooming -- manipulating people with fake kindness and attenion -- of the attackd groups easier and more likely.

It is a fair question if the people equating recognition and acceptance with grooming really fear the grooming of vunerable people or if they just rocoginze it as a way to trigger fear and reaction in people who fear the disruption of the old order of things and the unfounded assumptions on which their notions of "normal" and "natural" are based.
