# Running the Numbers

As I write this, in January of 2025, Elon Musk, 53 and thought to be the richest person on the planet according to the [Forbes Real-Time Billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires) page has reported net worth of $416 billion. Number 2 is Jeff Bezos with $233 billion. Mark Zuckerberg is number 3 with $213 billion. Down at 16 we find Bill Gates with $103 billion. The right wing's bogey man, George Soros is number 398 with a mere $7.2 billion.

Net worth, not surprisingly, tends to increase with age. In the [US the median ***household*** net worth](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/average-net-worth-by-age) for folk in Musk's age range (45-54) is $247,200. Net worth in the US peaks for folks between 65 and 74 at $409,900. Musk is 1.7 **million** times wealthier than his median peer. Looked at another way, if you are Musk's median peer you might spend $1 with the same level of concern that $1,700,000 causes for Elon Musk. We'll work on making that make sense in a moment.

## A Bit of Statistics

In statistics the median is the "middle value" so the median net worth is the net worth where half of the households in the country have less wealth, and half have more. It doesn't tell us how the wealth is distributed, just where the mid-point is. For example the median of the values 1, 2, and 100,000,000 is 2. So is the median of 1, 2, and 3.

Another measure is the average. In the US the average (aka the mean) household net worth for folks in the 45-54 age bracket is $975,800. Average household net worth in the US peaks at $1.79 million for folks in the 65-74 bracket. The average is calculated as the sum of the net worth of all of the households in the country divided by the number of households. 

The average is a funny number, there don't have to be many or even *any* average households. For example the average of 1, 2, and 12 is 5, but we don't have any data points that are anywhere near 5. The same thing happens with net worth. The billionaires are averaged in with the paupers and we get a number that doesn't necessarily tell us anything terribly useful about the financial condition of our fellow citizens. But it does give us a feel for the level of equity -- or in the case of the US, inequity -- in wealth. 

The difference between the median net worth of $247,000 and the average of $975,800 -- almost four times -- is already a sign that there are large inequities in the society. But even if we use the average net worth, Musk is still absurdly wealthy, he is still 426,000 times richer than the average household. When the average middle aged American is pondering spending $1, Elon Musk is wondering about $500,000.

## The Bbuck

Those are hard numbers for me to get my head around, so I propose some "thought experiments" loosely modeled on the photographer Chris Jordan's work "[Running the Numbers](https://www.chrisjordan.com/Running-the-Numbers/1/thumbs)". Here's how to start:

* Make an estimate of your net worth. If you don't know pick the average if you're feeling well to do, or the median if you're feeling a bit insecure. Take half the median if things are kind of tight. You get the idea.
* Divide that number into the net worth of your "favorite" billionaire. Now you know what $1 to you means to them, lets call the result a Bbuck (as in billionaire buck). Don't reach for your pitchfork yet.
* Now pick something that you would casually spend money on -- say a cup of coffee or parking or a bridge toll, maybe even a nice dinner with a friend.
* Multiply that number by your Bbuck.
* Now try to think about how you'd spend that much money on that thing...

## Examples

### Our average American

Networth $1,000,000 just to make the math easy. Using Elon Musk as the reference billionaire, a Bbuck is $416,000 of your dollars.

### A cup of coffee

In most places you can probably get a half-way decent cup of coffee for around $5. What could you do for a 5 Bbucks?

Walk into the coffee shop and order your latte. Then... 
* tip the whole staff with free tuition at a pretty good college.
* give the barrista your card and ask them to give you a call if they'd like to open their own coffee shop.

### Bridge toll

For something between $5 and $15 you can probably get across most of the tolled bridges in the US, so what will, say 10 Bbucks, let you do?

Pull into the toll booth, then...
* hand the attendant for your toll and the next 1,000,000 cars behind you.
* pay off the student loans for everyone working that day.
* start a fund for suicide nets or a fence on the bridge -- if the bridge was your regular commute, you could have it paid for in a couple of months.

Or skip the bridge, and...
* buy a helicopter to take you where you're going, when you get there donate it to a community that needs an air ambulance.
