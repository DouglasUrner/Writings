# The Right to Kill

We should be clear, Luigi Mangione's transgression was not killing someone -- we are quite clear that there are many situtations where we consider killing to be, at the very least, "not criminal." Luigi Mangione's crime was to usurp the power to commit murder that the state reserves for itself and those to whom the power to commit murder is duely delegated.

The state's "right" to commit murder is essential to the preservation of the state's coercive power -- the state's ability to say "or else."

The right of the state to use murder as the ultimate sanction rests on the belief that the state will only commit murder as a last resort and only in cases of the most serious of transgressions. The willingness of people (citizens / subjects of the state) to cede their right of self-defense rests on the belief that the state will be fair and even handed in its assumption of the responsibility of protecting them.
