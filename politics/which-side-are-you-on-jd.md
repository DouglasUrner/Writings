# Which Side Are You On JD?

“a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” (JD Vance to Tucker Carlson, 2021)

"Why is this just a normal fact of... life for the leaders of our country to be people who don't have a personal and direct stake in it via their own offspring?" (JD Vance [quoted by Tucker Carlson, 2021](the-quote))

On the 21st of July, 2024, Will Chamberlin, the consevative lawyer, "wartime conservative," and former DeSantis campaign staffer took to X to make a succinct and eloquent argument for the importance of DEI (aka diversity, equity, and inclusion, aka the boogeyman) efforts:

["Really simple, underdiscussed reason why Kamala Harris shouldn’t be President<br/><br/>No children"](https://x.com/willchamberlain/status/1815150185300759014)
<br/>
["And no, becoming a step-parent to older teenagers doesn’t count"](https://x.com/willchamberlain/status/1815150379610382598)
<br/>
["The concerns of parents and families will always be abstract to her"](https://x.com/willchamberlain/status/1815150588901933256)

I'm sure Mr. Chamberlin though he was making a searing attack on Vice President Kamala Harris and her fitness to serve as President, but the foundation of his argument -- that the lived experince of others is often hard to get our heads around, even with the best of intentions -- speaks directly to the importance of DEI.
