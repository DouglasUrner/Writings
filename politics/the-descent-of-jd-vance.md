# The Descent of JD Vance

When I first read the story of JD Vance's friendship with Sophia Nelson it seemed that he had once been a "descent conservative" -- a modern exemplar of the type that had once agreed with the "left" about the core virtues and weaknesses of this country but saw different causes and solutions.

Somehow he morphed from a [Nelson quote here] into a charictiture fawning at the feet of Donald Trump. His transition seemed to be a mystery.

Around this time I started reading Elle Reeve's "[Black Pill][black-pill]" and was struck by her obeservations about the path to credibility and respect on the "chans" coming from winning a "race to the bottom."

Listening to Sophia Nelson's account of her friendship with JD Vance and his transition into his current form I was struck by her description of the way his behavior changed. 

Vance might once have been in a position to repair the collapse of the Republican party and to restore the credibility of conservatism -- but he lacked the courage and the integrity to stand up for his principles. Instead he sold his soul for the hope of fame and power.
